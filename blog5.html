								<p> Most of the hosting network services have two types of offers for dedicated servers of which the first one enables users to order a physical one. As soon as it arrives, it is setup on the racks and its operating system is installed. Now, it is fully available to be accessed remotely. In the second case, the virtual servers come into view wherein the physical layer is abstracted. This type dedicated server enables users to get their very own servers which they can start using immediately. Both these types of dedicated servers have their own advantages which have been highlighted below.</p>
								
								<h4>Physical Servers</h4>
								<p>Users can get physical servers by following some simple steps that include hiring a hardware provider who will install the hardware for the users. The free rack unit will later be located by the technicians who will install the server and connect the cables and power supply. Later, the desired operating system is installed after consulting the user.</p>

								<p>Once the operating system and basic diagnostics are ready, the credentials are delivered to the user. This will enable the users to access their server remotely as well as to start installing the softwares that are needed by the user. The hosting provider is responsible only for offering reboots and hardware changes while the overall control of the server lies with the user. Apart from that, they also provide fast connectivity of the network due to which the server runs non-stop without any kind of problems.</p>
		
								<H4>Virtual Servers</H4>
								<p>The virtual dedicated servers or Infrastructure as a service is a way for the users to get their very own machines. In order to get such virtual dedicated servers, the users need to register their account with the hosting service provider and confirm their email and identity. Once the users have registered, the service provider’s control panel will be accessible to them. On the control panel, the users have to click on ‘New VM’ after which they need to select the operating system and wait for some time.</p>

								<p>This process will enable the users to get a new virtual machine by accessing it through SSH or VNC. Since the IP address for the system is assigned automatically, the users will be able to start installing the softwares on it. The servers run at all times unless the users turn them off manually so the users will be able to clone, erase, turn back on or even leave the server paused. The users not only have the facility to pay for the usage of the server by hour or capacity but are also able to increase or decrease power and cost between minutes. The usage of this facility is fully based on the user or the application being used. So, the users can choose whether they want this facility to be automated.</p>
		
								<H4>The right tool</H4>
								<p>There have been lots of advantages of the cloud computing platform but that doesn’t mean that a complete switch-over to the cloud servers should take place. Since, there are times when a physical server needs to be used, it is essential to get a really powerful server that will not cause any kinds of overheads. Many examples of such situations are available wherein a big database server is used for extensive data operations. Similarly, the game servers also handle thousands of users at the same time with ease.</p>

								<p>Since, a physical server enables users to know the exact location of the server due to which the server is completely free from any overhead as well as the underlying softwares. The cost-effectiveness of the cloud servers serves as a great advantage for medium or large companies that need to scale. This will ensure that the users are able to easily manage their own private dedicated servers as remote systems. Due to this, the users will be able to check problem by sitting at a virtual console. Most of the changes to the servers can be done by the user which otherwise would be solved only with the help of a technician.</p>

								<H4>Wrapping it up</H4>
								<p>Recently, people have started following a trend wherein they are switching to cloud servers which maybe private or public. Some others also prefer to use virtual servers directly. It is recommended to use virtual servers as they tend to give users more control over the resources. The main difference between both these servers is that physical servers need users to pay even when they aren’t accessing the web server. Conversely, the users need to pay for only those resources that they want to access using the virtual servers.</p>
