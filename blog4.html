								<p> Business technology consultants would have no job if every business leader was always completely aware of all the ways the technology in their industry is changing. The problem is, as the curve of technology’s advancement grows ever steeper on the timeline from the industrial revolution to the spread of the internet to mobile technology to cloud computing and big data, the task of keeping up and staying ahead becomes an ever taller order. </p>

								<p>Adapting to change has long been a key to the success of any business though technology is much more of a factor in business than it was hundreds of years ago or even thirty years ago. Cloud computing offers effectively limitless depth and scalability, so essentially, the flexibility to adapt to change of varying extremes in needed computing power is available to all (given a reliable and sufficient internet connection). The speed at which a business is able to accomplish adaptation to change is also essential and there the cloud offers quick implementation of its services even as its contents are in a state of flux.</p>
								
								<h4>Growing to Become an Enterprise</h4>
								<p>One of the reasons that the most successful businesses such as Amazon and eBay are so successful is that their infrastructure was designed to be scalable. Before cloud computing was on everyone’s lips, having too much investment in computing resources might have been a problem, but the advance of internet technology bridged a gap and breathed life into cloud computing, illustrating how technology feeds and builds on itself. In 1999, Salesforce was able to offer enterprise applications through the web and Amazon capitalized on their excess resources by offering scalable access to hardware and even personnel through the web in 2002. </p>

								<p>Smaller businesses and startups have to embrace the cloud in order to grow and compete. Especially during the first few years of a business’ existence, keeping costs down is a fervent focus. The low entry-cost and room to grow in cloud services makes them the only really sensible option.</p>
		
								<H4>Timing is Everything</H4>
								<p>One of the main reasons that any business project fails is that it runs into problems with resources not being in the right place at the right time. The accessibility and scalability of the cloud helps put the right amount of computing resources exactly where and when they are needed. With applications becoming increasingly integral to the functionality of the enterprise, this is ever more vital as it bodes well for the agility of software development.</p>
		
								<H4>Consumer Flux</H4>
								<p>Big data is also expected to be a key factor of successful enterprising in this decade. Business leaders hope to be able to have a much clearer understanding of their market through analysis of large data sets relating to consumers. Though the room for growth when utilizing cloud services is often cited as the benefit of its scalability, often overlooked is the fact that the ability to scale back can be just as important. </p>

								<p>Consumerism fluctuates due to a vast variety of factors. Big data will aid in clearly identifying factors and better predicting fluctuations. The ability to cut costs by scaling back rental of cloud services during the natural valleys of consumption will be every bit as useful as being able to scale up during peaks. Cloud vendors charging based on measurable usage of their service is a step into much greater economical use of computing resources.</p>

								<p>The importance of scalability of the computing infrastructure of businesses has been noted well before cloud computing became so prevalent. With the current state of technology, it has simply never been more important. The advantage of cloud’s scalability is such that avoidance bears the heavy risk of getting left behind by tomorrow’s enterprising competition.</p>
